<h3>How is this website made?</h3>
<ul> 
  <li>For frontend I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.</li> 
  <li>For Backend I used php programming language.</li> 
  <li>And for the database I used mysql.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>How to set up this website, on the online server?</h3>
<ul> 
  <li>We need to download the source file from Github:</li> 
  <li>Then unzip the file and we need to do some simple changes in code!!</li> 
  <li>We need to change our connection values from the config.php files.</li>
  <li>The (localhost will replace with your server name ), (root will replace with your Username ), ( “ ” will replace with your password),  ( “blog_post” will replace with your database name).</li> 
  <li>Completing the changes then save this file. Using ( Ctrl + S ).</li> 
</ul>

<h4>Next we need to create a database for our Data!</h4>

<h3>Go to your database and create a table.</h3>
<ul> 
  <li>After coming on the mysql server click on new and create a new database (Database name Is blog_post ).</li> 
  <li>In this database we need to create 2 tables. </li> 
  <li>Fast Table is for our users data  and Second table is for our Posts data.</li> 
  <li>For creating a user table ( click on the blog_post and click on new (after that give an Table name: post_data ). Then get 5 column for id, title, dise, image and   post_date</li> 
  <li>Then we need to create another table for users (click on the blog_post and click on new (after that give a Table name: users ) Then get 4 columns for id, name,     email and Password.</li> 
</ul>
